# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import numpy module to use built-in functions 
### Step 2: Get lists from the linear equations and assign it to np.array
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Print the result.
### Step 5: End the program.
### PROGRAM:
     #Program to find the distance between two points.
     #Developed by: rohit
     #RegisterNumber: 2122222240083
     import math as m
     l1=[4,2]
     l2=[10,6]
     d=m.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l1[1]-l2[1])**2))
     print("{:.2f}".format(d))

  


### OUTPUT:
